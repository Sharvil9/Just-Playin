## 🔮 What Fresh Sorcery is This?  
Welcome, brave artist, to the Kaleido-Doodler 3000™! This isn't your grandma's kaleidoscope (unless your grandma was a JavaScript wizard). It's a cutting-edge* digital canvas where your frantic mouse movements are transformed into mesmerizing, symmetrical patterns of questionable artistic merit! Built with the arcane power of p5.js, it takes your input and spins it into visual feedback loops that might just hypnotize you into forgetting to blink.  

*"Cutting-edge circa the last stable version we managed to get working reliably."*

## 🎛️ Features (Or "Things You Can Twiddle")  

### ⚙️ Symmetry Slider  
- How many slices of awesome do you want?  
- Choose from 2 to 20! Go on, make it weird. We won't judge (much).  

### 🖋️ Stroke Weight Slider  
- Control the CHONKINESS of your lines and shapes  
- From delicate whispers to bold marker strokes that scream "I am drawing!"  

### ⏳ Fading Speed Slider  
- For when you enable...  

### 👻 Fading Trails Toggle  
- Check this box to turn your canvas into a psychedelic memory foam mattress for light  
- Lines fade gracefully into the void, leaving ghostly trails of your artistic journey  
- *(Warning: May induce flashbacks to 70s screen savers)*  

### 🎨 Draw Mode Select  
- Are you feeling linear (Line), well-rounded (Circle), or decidedly edgy (Square) today?  
- Choose your weapon!  

### ✨ Reflection Toggle  
- Double the fun! Mirrors your already mirrored patterns within each slice  
- It's like looking into a mirror holding another mirror, but with code!  

### 🚨 The Almighty Clear Button (and 'C' key)  
- Your panic button. Your fresh start  
- Your testament to the fact that nothing is permanent, especially digital doodles  
- Use it wisely, or use it often. It works. Always. We made sure this time. Seriously.

## 🎮 How To Operate

1. **Wiggle Your Mouse**  
   - Move it over the big black square (that's the canvas)  
   - Watch as colors happen. Science!  

2. **Fiddle With Knobs (Sliders & Toggles)**  
   - See "Features" above  
   - Adjust sliders. Toggle checkboxes. Observe results  
   - Pretend you know exactly what you're doing  

3. **Select Shapes**  
   - Use the dropdown  
   - Discover if you prefer drawing circles or squares today. Deep.  

4. **Press the Big Red Button**  
   - When your creation becomes an unspeakable horror (or just a bit messy)  
   - Hit "Clear" or tap 'C'. Ahh, sweet oblivion  

5. **Repeat**  
   - There is no escape  
   
   **Btw you should right click to take a screenshot when you've created a masterpiece of yours.**

## 🤔 Known Quirks & Design Choices  

### ❓ Where's the Save Button?  
- Gone. Reduced to atoms  
- We decided the ephemeral nature of your creations was more profound  
- Also, getting it to work reliably across different versions was... character-building  
- Let's just say your art lives only in the moment (and your memory, maybe)  

### 🖤 Why Always Black Background?  
- Because it's slimming!  
- And makes the colors pop  
- And because the background color picker mysteriously vanished during the Great Reversioning of '25  

### 🎨 Is it Art?  
- Probably not, but it is fun
